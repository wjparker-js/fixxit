Product Requirements Document (PRD) for "Fix It" Application

## Introduction
The "Fix It" application aims to streamline the reporting and remediation of hazards and defects via a mobile app, connecting users to a backend server that manages the logic and data needs. This document outlines the required API endpoints, system design considerations, and potential uses for the technology.

## Objectives
1. Allow users to report hazards/defects with text descriptions and images.
2. Facilitate the assignment and management of remediation work orders.
3. Provide an administrative interface for real-time reporting and oversight.
4. Ensure seamless communication between users and employees regarding work orders.

## Key Features
1. **User Profile Management**
   - User Registration/Login
   - Profile Edit
   - Role Management (User/Administrator)

2. **Hazard/Defect Reporting**
   - Text and image inputs for reports
   - GPS location tagging (optional)

3. **Work Order Management**
   - Creation, assignment, acceptance, and rejection of work orders
   - Scheduling for remediation activities

4. **Real-time Administrative Dashboard**
   - View incoming reports
   - Accept/Reject reports and remediation
   - Communication interface with employees

5. **Documentation and Backup**
   - Store reports, images, and schedules
   - Generate various reports based on data collected

## Proposed API Endpoints
The following API endpoints will be implemented to support the core functionalities of the application:

### User Management
- **POST /api/users/register**: Register a new user (name, email, password).
- **POST /api/users/login**: Authenticate user and return a token.
- **GET /api/users/{id}**: Retrieve user profile information.
- **PUT /api/users/{id}**: Update user profile information.
- **DELETE /api/users/{id}**: Deactivate user account.

### Hazard Reporting
- **POST /api/reports**: Submit a new hazard report including text and up to 3 images.
- **GET /api/reports/{id}**: Retrieve details of a specific report.
- **GET /api/reports**: List all reports submitted by the user.

### Work Order Management
- **POST /api/workorders**: Create a new work order based on an accepted report.
- **GET /api/workorders/{id}**: Retrieve details of a specific work order.
- **PUT /api/workorders/{id}/accept**: Accept a work order.
- **PUT /api/workorders/{id}/reject**: Reject a work order.
- **PUT /api/workorders/{id}/schedule**: Update the proposed schedule for remediation.

### Remediation Tracking
- **POST /api/remediation/{workorderId}**: Document remediation actions with images and notes.
- **GET /api/remediation/{workorderId}**: View remediation documentation for a specific work order.

### Administrative Functions
- **GET /api/admin/reports**: Retrieve all reports for administrative review.
- **GET /api/admin/workorders**: List all work orders and their status.
- **PUT /api/admin/workorders/{id}/close**: Close a work order after remediation acceptance.
- **PUT /api/admin/workorders/{id}/reassign**: Reassign a work order to another employee.

### Backup and Reporting
- **POST /api/backups**: Initiate a backup of the current database state.
- **GET /api/reports/generate**: Generate reports based on specific criteria (date range, user reports, etc.).

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend (Admin Interface)**: React.js (for web-based testing)
- **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter (for cross-platform compatibility)

## Development Stages
### Stage 1: API Development
- **Define API Endpoints**: As outlined above.
- **Set up Backend Framework**: Start with Express.js setup in Node.js.
- **Database Schema Creation**: SQL scripts to create user, reports, and work order tables.

### Stage 2: Web-based Testing Application
- **Build Admin Interface**: Create a simple React app to test API endpoints.
- **Functionality**: Implement forms to submit reports and manage work orders for testing.

### Stage 3: Mobile Application Development
- **Design UI/UX**: Focus on user-friendly reporting and interaction.
- **Integrate API**: Connect mobile app to backend services.

### Stage 4: Quality Assurance
- **Testing**: Perform unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT) on both web and mobile platforms.
- **Bug Fixes**: Address any issues encountered during testing.

### Stage 5: Deployment and Iteration
- **Deploy Backend**: Set up cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- **Launch Application**: Roll out the mobile app and monitor performance.
- **Iterate**: Gather user feedback and make necessary adjustments.

## Considerations for Mobile Reporting and Broader Applications
- **Privacy and Security**: Handle user data responsibly, comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Consider implementing push notifications for updates on reports and work orders.
- **Integration with Other Systems**: Identify opportunities for integration with maintenance systems for broader use cases (e.g., site maintenance, inspections).
- **Analytics and Reporting Features**: Utilize data collected for insights into common hazards, response times, and resource allocation.

## Conclusion
The "Fix It" application aims to provide significant value through efficient reporting and management of hazards and defects. By carefully defining API endpoints and considering the development stages outlined, the project can be executed systematically. Furthermore, the versatility of the mobile application opens the door for other contextual uses in maintenance and safety oversight.
