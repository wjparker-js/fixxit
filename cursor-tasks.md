 will start by reading the new clause fixxit prompt.md file to understand the project requirements.
I have read the first 250 lines of the new clause fixxit prompt.md file. I will now read the remaining lines to get the complete picture of the project requirements.
I have finished reading the new clause fixxit prompt.md file. I have the complete context of the project requirements. What would you like to do next?
design a development plan and break it into tasks and subtasks. maintain the task list throughout the development and do mnot deviate fromm your design unless approved.  think like an experienced software engineer, employ best reactice and pay strict attention to your user rule and for each technology employed in the design make use of the context7 mcp server tto first retrieve and review the documentation.  try not to lose the context

Okay, I will design a development plan based on the new clause fixxit prompt.md file, breaking it down into tasks and subtasks. I will maintain this list and not deviate from it unless approved.
As an experienced software engineer, I will incorporate best practices. Following your instructions, before detailing the plan for each technology, I will use the Context7 MCP server to retrieve and review the relevant documentation.
Let's begin by retrieving documentation for Node.js and Express.js, which are foundational to Phase 1 of the plan outlined in the prompt.
Okay, I will design the development plan based on the provided prompt, breaking it down into tasks and subtasks. I will strictly adhere to this plan and only deviate if explicitly approved. For each technology used in the design, I will first retrieve and review its documentation using the Context7 MCP server.
Let's begin with Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure.

Okay, I have retrieved documentation for Helmet.js and confirmed that the helmet npm package is the appropriate one for securing Express.js applications by setting various HTTP headers.
I will now retrieve documentation for CORS and express-rate-limit to complete the planning for implementing security middleware in Task 1.3.
I have identified several potential matches for "CORS". The most relevant one for an Express.js backend is likely the cors middleware. I will search for documentation specifically for "cors middleware express".
I have retrieved documentation for Helmet.js and CORS middleware for Express.js. Now I will retrieve documentation for express-rate-limit to complete the planning for implementing security middleware.
I have identified /express-rate-limit/express-rate-limit as the relevant Context7 library ID for express-rate-limit. Now I will retrieve the documentation for it.

Subtask 2.1.1: Choose and implement a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT, session-based).
Before detailing this subtask, I will retrieve documentation for Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js.
I have identified /jaredhanson/passport-google-oauth2 as a relevant Context7 library ID, but it is specifically for the Google OAuth2 strategy. To choose and implement a secure authentication mechanism, I need to investigate the core Passport.js library documentation first. I will search for the Context7 library ID for "Passport".
I have identified /jaredhanson/passport as the relevant Context7 library ID for the core Passport.js library. Now I will retrieve the documentation for it.
