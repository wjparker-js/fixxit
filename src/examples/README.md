# Sequelize Create Method Demonstration

This directory contains examples that demonstrate how Sequelize's `create()` method works behind the scenes, specifically for the User model in the Fixxit application.

## Files Included

1. `sequelizeCreateDemo.js` - A runnable script that shows the actual SQL generated when creating a user
2. `userCreateExplanation.md` - A detailed explanation of the entire process

## How to Run the Demo

```bash
node src/examples/sequelizeCreateDemo.js
```

## What You'll See

When you run the demo, you'll see:

1. The input data (name, email, password)
2. The exact SQL statement that Sequelize generates
3. The returned user object with the password now hashed
4. A step-by-step explanation of the entire flow

## Understanding the Output

The demo shows how Sequelize:

1. Takes your JavaScript object (`{name, email, password}`)
2. Applies the `beforeCreate` hook to hash the password
3. Generates an `INSERT` SQL statement with all fields (including defaults)
4. Executes the SQL against the database
5. Returns a complete user object with all fields populated

This demonstrates the transformation from a simple JavaScript object to a database record and back, highlighting how the ORM abstracts away the SQL complexity while providing powerful features like hooks for password hashing.
